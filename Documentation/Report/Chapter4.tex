\begin{itemize}
\item First the overall methodology using a figure: different components
\item Explain in detail each component: it's based on the previous chapter, algorithms if an existing algorithm is extended, 
\item use examples
\item no code but pseudo-code
\item the link to your Github must appear in first title page (as a footnote). make sure that the supervisors and me have the access. 
A text file called readme.text must explain ho to run your program, using your dataset
